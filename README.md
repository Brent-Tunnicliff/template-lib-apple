# template-lib-apple

Template as a base for all my Apple libraries.
Project contains the package and a nested demo app `Demo/`.

If you want to run the Demo app, open its project file `Demo/Demo.xcodeproj`.

After generating the repository find all cases of `REPLACE_ME` and `REPLACE-ME` and rename them.

## Disclaimer

This project is open source and open to anyone to use as they see fit.
But I am building this with myself as the main target audience, so this will not be published anywhere.
