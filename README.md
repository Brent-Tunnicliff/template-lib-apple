# template-lib-apple

Template as a base for all my Apple libraries.
Project contains the package and a nested demo app `Demo/`.
Only the package or the demo app can be opened at a time.

After generating the repository find all cases of `REPLACE_ME` and rename them.

## Disclaimer

This project are open source and open to anyone to use as they see fit.
But I am building these with myself as the main target audience,
so this will not be published anywhere.
