# template-lib-apple

Template as a base for all my Apple libraries.
Project contains the package and a nested demo app `Demo/`.

If you want to run the Demo app, open its project file `Demo/Demo.xcodeproj`.

After generating the repository find all cases of `REPLACE_ME` and `REPLACE-ME` and rename them.

## Source Stability

The versioning of this package follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Source breaking changes to public API require a new major version.

We'd like this package to quickly embrace Swift language and toolchain improvements, and expect the latest Swift toolchains to be used (i.e. latest public Xcode version). So we will include updating the Swift version of the package as a new minor version bump.

## Disclaimer

This project is open source and open to anyone to use as they see fit.
But I am building this with myself as the main target audience, so this will not be published anywhere.
